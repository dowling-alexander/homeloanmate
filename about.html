    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I created <strong>HomeLoanMate</strong> because, like many of you, I was frustrated by the complexity and constant push to sign up, give my details, or get sales calls from other loan websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      All I wanted was a <strong>simple, honest tool</strong> that could quickly tell me my borrowing power or estimate repayments — to help me decide if a property was realistically within reach or just a pipe dream.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s exactly what this website is: a <strong>no-strings-attached</strong> place to get straightforward answers without being pressured or tracked.
    </p>

    <p>
      There’s no collection of your personal data here. The only “cost” is if you choose to support the site by clicking on affiliate links or checking out relevant ads — which helps keep HomeLoanMate free and available for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is simple: to give you a solid footing in a confusing world of loans and property buying — because <strong>everyone deserves clear, unbiased information.</strong>
