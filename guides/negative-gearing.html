      <p class="helper">Updated 30 Nov 2025 · 4–6 min read</p>

      <div class="card" aria-label="At a glance">
        <p><strong>At a glance:</strong> Negative gearing happens when your investment property costs more to hold than it earns. The loss may reduce your taxable income, giving you a partial tax refund. This guide explains how negative gearing works in Australia and how to read the results from the BorrowPower Negative Gearing Calculator.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What is Negative Gearing?</h2>
      <p>Negative gearing occurs when the ongoing costs of an investment property are higher than the rental income it produces. In other words, the property makes a loss each year.</p>

      <p>In simple terms:</p>
      <div class="card">
        <p><strong>You are negatively geared if:</strong><br>
        Rental Income &lt; Loan Interest + Property Expenses</p>
      </div>

      <p>Under Australian tax rules, this loss may be used to reduce your taxable income. That can result in a tax refund or lower tax payable, which reduces the out-of-pocket impact. But it is still a real loss — you are just getting some of it back via the tax system.</p>

      <h2>Why Do Investors Use Negative Gearing?</h2>
      <p>Negative gearing is common in Australia because many investors are comfortable taking a short-term loss if they expect long-term growth.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tax benefits:</strong> The property loss can often be deducted against your income, reducing the tax you pay.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to higher-growth areas:</strong> The tax offset may help make inner-city or high-demand suburbs more affordable to hold.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term strategy:</strong> Investors may accept a yearly loss if they expect capital gains to outweigh the cashflow cost over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>However, negative gearing is not free money. If the property does not grow in value, or if interest rates and expenses rise, the investor fully absorbs the losses.</p>

      <h2>How Negative Gearing is Calculated</h2>
      <p>The basic calculation compares:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>your <strong>rental income</strong>, and</li>
        <li>your <strong>property expenses</strong>, including loan interest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>1. Rental Income</h3>
      <p>This includes the rent you receive from tenants plus any other income (for example, parking, storage, or laundry income).</p>

      <p>In practice, rental income is rarely 52 full weeks per year. That’s why we adjust for vacancies to get a more realistic figure.</p>

      <h3>2. Property Expenses</h3>
      <p>Common costs included in negative gearing calculations are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Loan interest (often interest-only for investors)</li>
        <li>Property management fees</li>
        <li>Council and water rates</li>
        <li>Insurance</li>
        <li>Repairs and maintenance</li>
        <li>Body corporate / strata fees</li>
        <li>Other ongoing costs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Net Position Before Tax</h3>
      <p>Your net position before tax is:</p>
      <p><strong>Net Before Tax = Total Rental Income – Total Expenses</strong></p>
      <p>If this amount is negative, the property is negatively geared. If it is positive, the property is positively geared.</p>

      <h3>4. Tax Effect</h3>
      <p>If you are negatively geared, the loss may reduce your taxable income. The impact depends on your marginal tax rate.</p>
      <p>Example: If your property loss is $10,000 and your marginal tax rate is 32.5%, your tax reduction may be approximately $3,250.</p>

      <p>If your property is positively geared, the profit may increase your taxable income, meaning you could pay additional tax on that profit.</p>

      <h2>How the Negative Gearing Calculator Works</h2>
      <p>The BorrowPower Negative Gearing Calculator is designed to show you the after-tax cashflow impact of an investment property in clear dollar terms.</p>
      <p>When you use the calculator, you’ll see several key outputs. Here’s what each one means.</p>

      <h3>1. Gross Rental Income (after vacancy)</h3>
      <p>This is your annual rent adjusted for the vacancy rate you entered.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Annual rent: $30,000</li>
        <li>Vacancy rate: 5%</li>
        <li>Effective rent used in the calculator: $28,500</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Total Annual Expenses</h3>
      <p>This combines your loan interest and all other running costs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Loan interest:</strong> Calculated from your loan amount and interest rate (assuming interest-only repayments).</li>
        <li><strong>Other expenses:</strong> Management fees, rates, insurance, strata, repairs, and any other property costs you include.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The calculator adds these together to show your total annual expenses.</p>

      <h3>3. Net Position Before Tax</h3>
      <p>This is your rental income minus your total expenses. It shows whether the property is making a profit or loss before any tax benefits or tax payable are considered.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gross rental income (after vacancy): $28,500</li>
        <li>Total expenses: $44,000</li>
        <li>Net position before tax: –$15,500</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A negative number here means the property is negatively geared.</p>

      <h3>4. Tax Effect (Refund or Extra Tax)</h3>
      <p>The calculator then applies your selected marginal tax rate to estimate the tax impact:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If your net position is <strong>negative</strong>, it estimates the potential tax refund or tax saving from claiming that loss.</li>
        <li>If your net position is <strong>positive</strong>, it estimates the additional tax you may need to pay on the profit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This gives you a realistic view of how the tax system changes the final result.</p>

      <h3>5. Net Position After Tax (per year)</h3>
      <p>This figure shows the combined effect of your cashflow and the estimated tax outcome.</p>
      <p><strong>Net After Tax = Net Before Tax + Tax Effect</strong></p>
      <p>This number is often less negative than your before-tax result if the property is negatively geared, or slightly lower than your before-tax profit if it is positively geared.</p>

      <h3>6. Net Position After Tax (per week)</h3>
      <p>Many investors think in weekly numbers, so the calculator converts your after-tax result into a weekly figure.</p>
      <p><strong>Weekly After Tax = Net After Tax ÷ 52</strong></p>
      <p>This tells you the real-world weekly cost (or profit) of holding the property after tax.</p>

      <h2>Example: Putting It All Together</h2>
      <p>Here is a typical scenario to illustrate how the numbers work in the calculator:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Annual rent: $30,000</li>
        <li>Vacancy rate: 5%</li>
        <li>Loan amount: $600,000</li>
        <li>Interest rate: 6%</li>
        <li>Other expenses: $8,000</li>
        <li>Marginal tax rate: 32.5%</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The calculator may show something like:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gross rental income (after vacancy): $28,500 per year</li>
        <li>Total annual expenses: $44,000 per year</li>
        <li>Net position before tax: –$15,500 per year</li>
        <li>Estimated tax refund / saving: around $5,000 per year</li>
        <li>Net position after tax: roughly –$10,500 per year</li>
        <li>After-tax cost: about –$200 per week</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This view helps you decide if the expected long-term capital growth justifies the short-term weekly cost.</p>

      <h2>Pros and Cons of Negative Gearing</h2>

      <h3>Potential benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces taxable income when the property is making a loss</li>
        <li>Can make higher-priced growth areas more affordable to hold</li>
        <li>Supports long-term capital growth strategies</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key risks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Still a real cash loss each year, even after tax</li>
        <li>Requires stable income and good buffers</li>
        <li>Vulnerable to interest rate rises and higher expenses</li>
        <li>Relies on future property price growth, which is not guaranteed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>Is negative gearing always a good idea?</h3>
      <p>No. Negative gearing can be appropriate for some investors with strong incomes, good buffers, and a long investment horizon. For others, the ongoing cash loss may create financial stress, especially if rates rise or the property does not grow as expected.</p>

      <h3>Does the calculator include tax depreciation?</h3>
      <p>The BorrowPower Negative Gearing Calculator focuses on the main cashflow items: rent, interest, and typical running costs. Tax depreciation schedules and non-cash deductions are not automatically included, as these vary by property and need professional advice to estimate.</p>

      <h3>Do all lenders treat negative gearing the same way?</h3>
      <p>No. Lenders have different credit policies. Some may shade rental income, apply different expense assumptions, or treat negative gearing differently when assessing your borrowing capacity. Our calculator is a general guide, not a lender credit calculator.</p>

      <h3>What tax rate should I choose in the calculator?</h3>
      <p>If you’re not sure, you can start with an approximate marginal tax rate based on your income bracket (for example 30% or 32.5%). For an accurate rate and to understand how negative gearing affects your overall tax, speak with an accountant or tax adviser.</p>

      <h3>Where can I check my borrowing power?</h3>
      <p>You can use our main <a href="/">Borrowing Power Calculator</a> to see how income, expenses, interest rates, and buffers combine to set your maximum loan size. You can then use the Negative Gearing Calculator to understand the cashflow impact of a specific investment property.</p>
