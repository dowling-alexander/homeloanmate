  <p>HomeLoanMate provides general information only and is <strong>not financial or credit advice</strong>. Results are estimates based on your inputs and standardised assumptions (including the 2025/26 AU tax bands, living expense floors by dependants, a 3% serviceability buffer, and an approximate LMI model). They donâ€™t consider your objectives, financial situation or needs. Lending criteria, interest rates, fees and government charges (including stamp duty) vary by lender and state.</p>
  <p>We use your existing state stamp duty tables in the calculator. Our LMI estimate is an approximation; actual premiums vary by lender/insurer and loan details. Consider seeking independent, licensed advice before making decisions.</p>
