    <h2>How do you estimate LMI?</h2>
    <p>If your Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR) is above 80%, we apply a tiered LMI approximation based on your LVR band and loan size. The estimate ranges from ~0.7%–0.9% (80–85% LVR) up to ~2.6%–3.2% (90–95% LVR). We default to capitalising LMI into the loan but you can switch to paying it upfront. Actual LMI varies by lender/insurer and application details.</p>

    <h2>Which tax year do you use when converting gross to net income?</h2>
    <p>We use the 2025/26 ATO resident income tax bands. These exclude the 2% Medicare levy and any Medicare Levy Surcharge or offsets. You can turn tax conversion off and enter your net position directly. <em>Australian Taxation Office</em></p>

    <h2>How are living expenses and dependants handled?</h2>
    <p>We enforce a conservative minimum monthly expense floor that scales with the number of dependants (0–6). You can enter higher expenses; the floor prevents unrealistically low costs of living.</p>

    <h2>Do you include stamp duty and state costs?</h2>
    <p>Yes. We reference the state stamp duty tables already in the app’s <code>script.js</code> for indicative calculations. Check your state/territory revenue office or your lender for exact, current amounts.</p>

    <h2>Why add a 3% serviceability buffer?</h2>
    <p>Lenders assess your ability to repay at a higher “buffered” rate to account for potential rate rises. We default to +3% on top of your entered rate; you can toggle this.</p>

    <h2>Is this financial advice?</h2>
    <p>No. BorrowPower is a general-information tool only. Speak to a licensed professional for advice tailored to you.</p>
